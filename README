An implementation of Unicorn Herder as a single file bash script
https://github.com/alphagov/unicornherder/

Usage: ./unicornbasher (gunicorn|unicorn) --pid pidfile.pid --bind 127.0.0.1:4000 myapp.wsgi:application

Implements almost the same logic as Unicorn Herder but does not
automatically pass the --daemon argument so you can run the master
process undaemonized and let it write its logs to stdout, which is
critical for well-behaved applications (see http://12factor.net/logs)
